The fact that the velocity Verlet method has a smaller amplitude in the oscillations for both the angular momentum and energy and has a smaller deviation of the centre of the oscillations in the energy-plot than the Euler-simulation, indicates that Verlet method is more stable and that it conserves energy better.
